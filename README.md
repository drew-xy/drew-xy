## About Drew ❗

So here's a little bit about me : )

- 🔭 I've recently finished a few projects and I'm looking to work on some side projects I've had in mind
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS, C# and Python
- 👯 I’m not looking to collaborate as of yet
- 💬 Ask me about anything! 💥
- ⚡ Fun fact: GitHub's a nice fresh start for me ;)
